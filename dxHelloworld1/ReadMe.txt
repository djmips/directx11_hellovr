WIN32 Application: DxHelloworld1 Project Overview
========================================================================

The Application wizard has created this dxHelloworld1 application for you.

This document outlines the contents of each file that makes up the dxHelloworld1 application.


DxHelloworld1.vcxproj
This is the main project file for VC ++ projects generated using the Application Wizard, which contains the version information of Visual C++ that generates the file, and information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected by using the Application Wizard.

DxHelloworld1.vcxproj.filters
This is the VC ++ project filter file that is generated using the Application Wizard. It contains information about the association between the project file and the filter. In the IDE, this association displays files with similar extensions in grouped form under specific nodes. For example, the .cpp file is associated with the source file filter.

DxHelloworld1.cpp
This is the main application source file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
The application wizard creates the following resources:

DxHelloworld1.rc
This is a list of all Microsoft Windows resources that the program uses. It includes icons, bitmaps, and cursors stored in the RES subdirectory. This file can be edited directly in Microsoft Visual C++.

Resource.h
This is a standard header file that can be used to define a new resource ID. Microsoft Visual C++ will read and update this file.

DxHelloworld1.ico
This is an icon file used as an application icon (32x32). This icon is included in the main resource file dxHelloworld1.rc.

Small.ico
This is an icon file that contains a smaller version of the application's icon (16x16). This icon is included in the main resource file dxHelloworld1.rc.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard documents:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
These files are used to generate a precompiled header (PCH) file named DxHelloworld1.pch and a precompiled type file named StdAfx.obj.

The application Wizard uses "TODO:" comments to indicate parts of the source code that should be added or customized.
